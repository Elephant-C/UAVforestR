# UAVforestR
Measuring forest quality using UAV imagary and structure from motion data

## Testing all segmentation parameters
This is an engine for running through a list of reasonable parameters
for ITC segment update fast_gobble.R and calculating their performance 
based on a comparison with manually segmented tree crowns.

It should enable the selection of a useful set of parameters specifically 
for identifying trees which can be segmented with a high level of confidence.
